# Notepad Dark Mode

Notepad++ is a very nice feature-rich text editor. But sometimes you just
don't need those features, and something simple and basic is better.
Windows 11's Notepad is very strong in this regard, however the caching of
unsaved files can sometimes be a little annoying.
Windows 10's Notepad is perfect, except it doesn't come with a dark mode,
so my poor eyes suffer.

Introducing Notepad Dark Mode: an original-Notepad clone that you can use
without wearing sunglasses.
